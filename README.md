# EMK_MARV
shared coding base for our MARV

don't work with the main branch

create a branch for yourself to work on

always pull when you come back to work on it, keeps the other code sections updated

for every push to the main branch we have to make sure that it wont break the existing code.

just occationally check if there is a merge or pull request and review it if you have time.
