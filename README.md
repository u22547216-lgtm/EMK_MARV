# Reccommendations for setting up github

clone the repository into the file that you intend to work in with MPLAB, it will require you to link VScode to your github account 

use the MPLAB X IDE for coding, debugging and compiling. 

there is an MPLAB extention in VScode if you want to write the code there instead of MPLAB

MPLAB does have built in github features, but the only thing i got to work there is commits, so just do the push and pull stuff on VScode

# Working with the repository

don't work with the main branch

create a branch for yourself to work on

always pull when you come back to work on it, keeps the other code sections updated

for every push to the main branch we have to make sure that it wont break the existing code.

just occationally check if there is a merge or pull request and review it if you have time.
